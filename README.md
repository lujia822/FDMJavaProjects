# FDMJavaProjects
Some pretty interesting java projects I've worked on during FDM training. I used Eclipse to write these. <br/>
<br/>
Week 1. Hangman - a simple console version of the word guessing game <br/>
Week 2. BookStoreJunit - a demonstration of test driven development with Junit <br/>
Week 2. BookStoreMockito - using Mockito to mock DB reader and writer <br/>
Week 3. CurrencyConverter - serialize and deserialize JSON with Jackson ObjectMapper. Also used log4j2 to generate logs. <br/>
Week 4. ElevatorSimulator - a group project that uses the concept of multithreading to create lifts that run simultaneously. I was responsible for the LiftController class which takes in requests and assigns them to the lifts. <br/>
Week 5-7. Java Solo Project - I chose to implement a multicurrency online banking system with Spring boot, JPA and MySQL. I used ThymeLeaf as my template engine and adhered to MVC when designing the application architeture. Modules currently include: Registration and Login, Account Overview, Transaction History, Create New Account, Add Currency to Existing Account, Convert between currencies, Transfer to Own Account, Transfer to Other Accounts. System calls a REST API I found on APILayer to obtain live exchange rates.
