# FDMJavaProjects
Some pretty interesting java projects I've worked on during FDM training. I used Eclipse to write these.
Week 1. Hangman - a simple console version of the word guessing game
Week 2. BookStoreJunit - a demonstration of test driven development with Junit
Week 2. BookStoreMockito - using Mockito to mock DB reader and writer
Week 3. CurrencyConverter - serialize and deserialize JSON with Jackson ObjectMapper. Also used log4j2 in this project to generate logs.
