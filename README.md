# FDMJavaProjects
Some pretty interesting java projects I've worked on during FDM training. I used Eclipse to write these. <br/>
Week 1. Hangman - a simple console version of the word guessing game <br/>
Week 2. BookStoreJunit - a demonstration of test driven development with Junit <br/>
Week 2. BookStoreMockito - using Mockito to mock DB reader and writer <br/>
Week 3. CurrencyConverter - serialize and deserialize JSON with Jackson ObjectMapper. Also used log4j2 to generate logs. <br/>
